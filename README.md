# Uber-Data-Analysis-through-Visualisations-in-R
Data storytelling is an important component of Machine Learning through which companies are able to understand the background of various operations. With the help of visualization, companies can avail the benefit of understanding the complex data and gain insights that would help them to craft decisions. This is more of a data visualization project that will guide you towards using the ggplot2 library for understanding the data and for developing an intuition for understanding the customers who avail the trips.
Important: The goal of this project is to learn visualisations in R. I do not claim copyright over any of the content here.
Importing necessary libraries
gplot2: ggplot2 is the most popular data visualization library that is most widely used for creating aesthetic visualization plots.
lubridate: Use time-frames in the dataset
dplyr: Data Manipulation
tidyr: Tidy the data
DT: Datatables in JS
scales: With the help of graphical scales, we can automatically map the data to the correct scales with well-placed axes and legends.
